== Task 1 - Implicit Flow

The first task is to use the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth[implicit flow]
to access a resource.

For this example, we use the aws cognito https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authorization-endpoint.html[authorization server].

Authorization Server URL:

 https://devjourfix-willhaben-test.auth.eu-central-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize

You need to add following query parameters:

.Query Parameters
|===

|`client_id` | `3can53th3tlmsnhcn1buji30i8`

|`redirect_uri` | `http://localhost:8080/callback`

|`scope` | ?

|`response_type` | ?

|===


Fill in the missing query parameters (?) required by the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthorizationEndpoint[standard]
and build a simple html link.


The authorization server will, after the user enters her username and password redirect back to
the `redirect_uri`.

Extract the `id_token` and use it to access the protected resource:

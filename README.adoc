= OAuth 2.0 workshop

This repo contains tasks for the willhaben OAuth 2.0 workshop.

The files in `api` contain the tasks for the participants. Files in this directory are mapped to an aws api gateway endpoint (`https://5ddwj6qy0l.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod`). `task0.adoc` maps to the root resource, the other tasks map to their respective file name minus `.adoc`. 

Participants have to obtain various tokens from an authorization server (aws cognito) to complete the workshop. 

To access task 1 you dont need any tokens.

To access task 2, participants need a valid token from task 1, and so on until they reach task4. When solved, task 4 povides a "keyword" which completes the challenge.
